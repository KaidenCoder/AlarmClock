## My process

First, I designed the skeleton of the design using HTML and CSS. Then, I started coding in Javascript and also made changes in HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I got to learn how to use audio sound in alarm clock and manipulate the Date function

```js
var sound = new Audio("ringtone.mp3");
sound.loop = true;
```

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript getMilliseconds() Method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getmilliseconds.asp) - The getMilliseconds() method returns the milliseconds (from 0 to 999) of the specified date and time.
